# React-Redux Thunk Middleware
This repo is an adaptation of [React Redux Toolkit Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M1J5I1w2-uZx36Qp6qhjKo) by Dave Gray. 

I followed the tutorial series to learn how to:
- **Create Async Redux Thunk to Fetch data from and Post data to a REST API**
- Redux does everything Synchronously 
- Anything Async has to happen outside the store 
- This is where Redux Middleware comes in
- The most common Async middleware is Redux Thunk
- Thunks are recommended as the standard approach for writing Async logic with Redux
- The word **"thunk"** is a programming term that means *"a piece of code that does some delayed work."* - Wikipedia
