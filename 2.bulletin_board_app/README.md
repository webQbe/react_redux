# React-Redux Bulletin Board App
This repo is an adaptation of [React Redux Toolkit Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M1J5I1w2-uZx36Qp6qhjKo) by Dave Gray. 

I followed the tutorial series to learn followings:
- **Redux App Structure and Data Flow**
- Building a simple **React Bulletin Board** app
- **Managing Global State** with Redux Toolkit

## Inspecting with Redux Dev Tools browser extension
1. Open the app and create a new post
2. Open the extension on the browser: Press **F12** and select **Redux**
3. Select `State` > `Tree` > to see as expandable list
4. Select `State` > `Chart` to see as a chart
5. Select `State` > `Raw` to see as JSON
6. Select `Diff` to see the new post
